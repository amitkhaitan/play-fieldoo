  </div>
  <p class="verified-paragraph">The key is to get contacted by an agent, scout or club and not to contact an agent!
    Getting contacted or finding the right contact is not a simple task, as you must take a lot of factors in account.
    It is hard work and it takes extra effort off pitch, but it is essential part of your career. Here are some
    guidelines to find the best possible agent or industry contact.<br><br><span class="text-span-73">a.</span><br><br>Your
    Play profile is your football CV. When an agent or a scout ask you for your CV you send them your Play screen name
    link www.play.com/yourscreenname.<br><br><span class="text-span-74">b.</span><br><br>Complete your football CV.
    Agent won’t even look at empty or half completed profiles. You should always try to fully complete all aspects of
    your Play profile. Don’t expect to get contacted if you don’t have a profile photo or you only entered two years of
    football in your career history.<br><br><span class="text-span-75">c.</span><br><br>The most import part of your
    football CV is your promotional video. If you don’t have one create one as immediately.<a
      href="https://www.play.com/p/help#top"><br><br>‍</a><span class="text-span-76">d.</span><br><br>Always state your
    right career information. Every good agent will double check your career data and all information on you. Don’t lie
    or invent stuff.<a href="https://www.play.com/p/help#top"><br><br><span>‍</span></a><span
      class="text-span-77">e.</span><br><br>Know what you are looking for. If you are an upcoming player with big
    football dreams start by following and contacting an agent or agents from your region of activity. If you are
    seeking your last professional contract you should also try contacting agents from football exotic countries.<a
      href="https://www.play.com/p/help#top"><br><br><span>‍</span></a><span class="text-span-78">f.</span><br><br>All
    agents, scouts and clubs assess players the same way.<br><br><span class="text-span-79">g.</span><br><br>Use Play
    market classifieds and apply for posts. Apply only to classifieds you fit for. Don’t apply to post searching for EU
    players if you are from Nigeria or Argentina. Just don’t do it!<br><br><span class="text-span-80">h.<br></span><br>Never
    pay any money upfront to unknown agents, scouts or persons asking for it. Be careful, as not everybody has good
    intentions.<br><br><span class="text-span-81">i.</span><br><br>When contacting an agent stick to the facts, be
    realistic and don&#x27;t make abnormal demands. If you are currently playing in the 4th English Premier
    League.<br><br><span class="text-span-82">j.</span><br><br>Look around. There are thousands of agent, scouts, and
    club representatives looking for football players on Play. Ask your Play network – friends and teammates for
    recommendation.<br><br><span class="text-span-83">k.</span><br><br>Always do your own diligence. Play does verify
    agent information, but cannot and doesn’t guarantee their intentions.<br><br><span
      class="text-span-84">l.</span><br><br>Indemnify Play. You must agree not to hold us responsible for anything. We
    are here to help, but all the decisions are you make on your own.<br><br><span

    <h1 class="h1-heading">PLAY GUIDELINES FOR PLAYERS - <span class="text-span-119">HOW TO MAKE</span> A PROMO VIDEO
    </h1>
  </div>
  <p class="verified-paragraph">The football player&#x27;s promo video is one of the most important or even decisive
    things that make first impression on agents and scouts. That is why a player should have a quality promo video based
    on the qualities which agents and scouts like to see. Here are some guidelines on how to make the the best possible
    promo video to show your talent to the world. Promotional video is the most important part of your football CV. It
    is a short clip, made from various games (matches), where a player presents himself and emphasize his
    attributes.<br><br><span class="text-span-86">a.</span><br><br>The promo video must point out the best attributes
    according to the player&#x27;s position on the field, not just the best moves. <br><br>Learn on examples for:
    DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER: defensive play, tackling, positioning, reading the game, changing the sides of the play, short
    passes, long passes, long range shooting, set pieces, etc.; <br><br>GOALKEEPER: command of area, best saves, one on
    one situations, reaction to high balls, good technic, long balls shooting, long ball throwing, etc.; <br><br>STRIKER:
    goals from all positions, with both legs, with head, defensive working habits, ability to keep the ball, one on one
    situation, set pieces, etc.<br><br><span class="text-span-87">b.<br></span><br>The promo video has to be short.
    Ideally it should be from three (3) to maximum ten (10) minutes long.<br><br><span
      class="text-span-88">c.</span><br><br>If possible, the promo video should contain the footage from the competitive
    matches only. Agents and scouts need to see player&#x27;s reactions in real situations when there is lack of time
    and space and also reactions under pressure.<br><br><span class="text-span-89">d.</span><br><br>NEVER MAKE the promo
    video that contains juggling, free styling, free kicks taking only, futsal playing or playing for fun with
    friends.<br><br><span class="text-span-90">e.</span><br><br>A promo video must contain player&#x27;s basic info. Add
    an ID to your presentation, stating who you are: your name and surname, date of birth, position, club (former
    clubs), nationality, height/weight and any other relevant information that might interest your viewer.<br><br><span
      class="text-span-91">f.</span><br><br>Make sure that it is clearly visible who you are on the video.
    Post-production custom effects (for instance: highlighting your pitch position by a circle or a pointer,..) take
    some time, but are well worth it.<br><br><span class="text-span-92">g.</span><br><br>The footage has to be the
    highest quality possible.<br><br><span class="text-span-96">h.</span><br><br>Promo video should not be older than 1
    year, and should be regularly updated. If possible, update promo video all the time (at least once a year, that is).<br><br><span
      class="text-span-97">i.</span><br><br>Use only material that is relevant and up-to-date. Avoid using old footage;
    not only because a skilled agent or scout will know that the material is old, but also because – if everything is
    normal – newer footage should show better and new skills.<br><br><span class="text-span-98">j.</span><br><br>Make
    sure you have enough material (your football matches) to make a good compilation out of it. If your games are not on
    TV and nobody is filming them, it is up to you to get somebody who will catch you on tape. In today’s digitalized
    world, it shouldn’t be a problem.<br><br><span class="text-span-95">k.</span><br><br>Get to recordings of your
    matches or make sure (together with your team-mates) your matches are getting recorded. <br><br>ASK YOUR COACH. If
    you’re using videos to analyse your performance after the game then you can surely get a copy directly from your
    club. <br><br>GET IT DIRECTLY FROM A BROADCAST. If your matches are broadcasted live on TV, you can ask the TV
    station to give you a copy or have someone record the broadcast. <br><br>HIRE A CAMERAMAN or ask a friend. If above
    options aren’t possible than you can hire a cameraman. Talk to your teammates so you’ll be able to share expenses
    and get copies for everyone. If all of you pitch in you could even get a camera crew and end up with a professional
    recordings with multiple angles.<br><br><span class="text-span-94">l.</span><br><br>Whatever problem you encounter,
    there is always a solution:<br><br>Don&#x27;t have the footage from a competitive match? Use the footage from the
    friendly match.<br>Don&#x27;t have a high quality camera? Use a smart phone.<br>Don&#x27;t know how to cut the
    video? Use the YouTube Video Editor.<br><br><span class="text-span-93">m.</span><br><br>When in doubt, contact us
    for advice. We are here to help, but all the decisions are you make on your own.<br></p>

  <p class="verified-paragraph">The key is to gain experience and further your career. Play adds another dimension to
    your hard work as an agent, it gives you an online presence and opportunity to find new players and expand your

    when working of Play. Here are a few guidelines to help you make your Play experience better for
    everyone.<br><br>‍<span class="text-span-99">a.</span><br><br>Your Play profile is your business CV. When a club

    about yourself.<br><br><span class="text-span-101">c.</span><br><br>Always state your right career information.
    Every player, club representative and fellow agent will double check your career data and information on you before
    considering doing business with you. So will us. Don’t lie or invent stuff.<br><br><span
      class="text-span-102">d.</span><br><br>Know what you are looking for and what you offer. Fill in regions of
    activity you are or will be active in and be specific in your market posts.<br><br><span
      class="text-span-103">e.</span><br><br>Use Play Market and post offers and apply for posts. Apply only to
    classifieds you fit for. Don’t apply if a post is looking for a partnership in Brazil and you work in
    Sweden.<br><br><span class="text-span-104">f.</span><br><br>When contacting players and other agents stick to the
    facts, be realistic and don&#x27;t make abnormal demands.<br><br><span class="text-span-105">g.</span><br><br>Look
